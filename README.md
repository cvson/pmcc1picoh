this is based version to be managed by GIT
This is to test using response function from signal for sideband
1. fit on 5 bins of p-theta

2. Four sample maximum
  -Signal: from analysis I, veract <50 MeV
  -Sideband
  -Antipid with cc1pi-enhanced
  -Antipid with CC0pi-enhanced 

3. response function: 
-- use v1r19piless02 cor: tot_merged_ccqe_forResponseFunction_pionFS_v1r19piless02cor.root
-- fix float issue

4. included obervable information of vertex activity, other angles, Qsq
