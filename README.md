this is based version to be managed by GIT
This is to test using response function from signal for sideband
In this branches, there are four sample is used
-Signal: from analysis I, veract <50 MeV
-Sideband
-Antipid with cc1pi-enhanced
-Antipid with CC0pi-enhanced

The version included obervable information of vertex activity, other angles, Qsq
A fit is on 5 bin of p-theta
only non-side escaping sample isused
